	<h2>Seriously, you guys think that a fucking website doesn't need some styling?</h2>
	<p>You probably build websites using vim and feeling hardcore. You think your 4.99KB motherfuckingwebsite(.com) is going to get you some fucking award to put on your damn footer as a link. You think your fucking default font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster.
<br/><strong><font color = "red" class = "idi">WRONG</font></strong>, motherfucker.<br/></p>
	<br/><h2>The best kick-ass website:</h2><br/>
	<p>Let me describe the real perfect-ass website which still has the glory of the past 		motherfuckingwebsites:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li>Shit doesn't weigh a ton (in fact it's just 34.97 KB when the 27.83KB cat picture below is removed)</li>
		<li>The page weighs exactly 63.02kB, 93.7% less than the <a href = "www.google.com">Google home page</a></li>
		<li>Fits on your iPhone 1st gen (although it doesn't work on your damn 16x32 Tamagotchi)</li>
		<li><font color = whiteblue>blue</font> et <font color = #551a8b>violetish</font></li>
		<li>It probably doesn't support <span class = "fou" ::before></span> all the web browsers, but that's the best thing - if the user's browser is outdated </li>
		<li>javascript <img src = "js.svg" height = 15px title = "logo js" />
		html5 <img src = "html5.svg" height = 15px title = "logo html5" />
		css3 <img src = "css3.svg" height = 15px title = "logo css 3" /></li>
	</ul>
	<div class = "image">
	<img src = "cat.jpg" height = 240px/>
	</div>
	<div class = "suit">
		<p>paragraphe et paragraphe et encore des paragraphe</p>
	</div>

	<footer>
